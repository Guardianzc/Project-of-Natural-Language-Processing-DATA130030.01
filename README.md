   * [FinalProject_Commonsense Validation Model](./Final PJ)
   
## Details
**Project1-Pacman**
* In this project, my Pacman agent will find paths through the maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. I will build general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios. (Key words: DFS, BFS, UCS, A* Search, Heuristic function, Greedy)
* You can see the detail of project [here](./Project1_Pacman/search2019_2.zip) and my report [here](./Project1_Pacman/Report.pdf)
    
**Project2_Nqueens**
* In this project, I am going to construct a CSP for N-Queens problem.(Key words: Backtracking, CSP, AC-3)
* You can see the detail of project [here](./Project2_Nqueens/pj2.zip) and my report [here](./Project2_Nqueens/Report.pdf)

**Project3_Blackjack**
* In this project, I implement algorithms to find the optimal policy in some situations, also I formalize a modified version of Blackjack as an MDP, and apply the algorithm to find the optimal policy.(Key words: MDP)
* You can see the detail of project [here](./Project3_Blackjack/index.html) and my report [here](./Project3_Blackjack/Report.pdf)
    
**Project4_Cars**
* This project is a modified version of the Driverless Car assignment written by Chris Piech.
* In this project, I focus on the sensing system, which allows us to track other cars based on noisy sensor readings.(Key words: Bayesian network basics, Emission probabilities, Transition probabilities, Particle filtering)
* You can see the detail of project [here](./Project4_Cars/pj4.pdf) and my report [here](./Project4_Cars/Report.pdf)    

**FinalProject_GOMOKU**
* I do this project with [Ruipu Luo](https://rupertluo.github.io/)
* In this project, we design a fast and effective search algorithm for Gomoku playing.
* We use MCTS and Minimax search with $\alpha$-$\beta$ pruning algorithm for Gomoku and add the threat space algorithm to directly find those high-threat points in order to save search time. The  pruning  algorithm  can  reach  the  chess  power  of pisq7, which won the 24th place in the Gomoku AI Contest 2015.
* You can see the detail of project [here](./FinalProject_GOMOKU/Final_PJ.pdf) and my report [here](./FinalProject_GOMOKU/Alpha_Beta_Pruning_with_Thread_DetectionAlgorithm_for_Gomoku.pdf)
* More details about the project is updating...
